// // TWO KNIGHTS
// // here we have to place 2 knights on the nxn boord and find the possible places taht they dont attack each other
// // we will be given n which is rows and columns
// // for n=5
// // we have to find 1x1,2x2,3x3,4x4


// FORMULA->
// We find the combination of the knights on the board suing the 
// ncr formula where n is n**2 and r is 2, n is 1,2,3,4,5 for n=5 we will have to find the answer for all 5 events seperately

// ncr=x(x-1)/2
